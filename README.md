# KWin Notification Positioning Scripts

Collection of small extensions for KDEâ€™s window manager controlling notification placement on multi-monitor setups.

Based on https://github.com/nclarius/KWin-window-positioning-scripts (a similar extension set, but for windows).
I created this fork due to notification placement issues I was having on my Wayland multi-monitor setup.

For more information, please see the readmes in the individual folders.
